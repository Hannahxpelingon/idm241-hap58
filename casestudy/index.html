            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Microinteractions are small, yet impactful moments integrated in interfaces that shape users&apos; experience and their overall behavior when interacting with the product. This case study concentrates on redesigning a complex microinteraction within an existing interface. The project showcases how micro interaction design can clarify user intent, reduce friction, and create an engaging experience. Through detailed breakdowns of the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes, this study highlights how one small design consists of many parts to elevate the overall user journey.</p>

                    <p>Create and code a complex micro interaction that includes 5 triggers</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>For this case study, I chose to redesign an IKEA card carousel. Figure 1.1 showcases its current state. The current design features a horizontal, draggable bar, and. arrow controls to move the cards left and right.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-content-container">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                    <p>My initial goal was to make the card clearly feel clickable. Originally, the only cue was the cursor changing to a pointer on hover, which wasn&apos;t strong enough to signal interactivity. I also wanted to replace the draggable crossbar with clearer pagination to help users understand which set of cards they were viewing.

                <h3>Identifying microinteration opportunity</h3>
                <p>The design process began by analyzing the existing state of the IKEA carousel. This initial audit helped me identify where improvements could be made for a more intuitive experience.</p>

            <div class="sub-content-container">
                <h3>Protoyping</h3>
                <p>I began by prototyping in Figma to determine the structure of the carousel, which include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>card size and estimated space (subject to change due to responsiveness in code)</li>
                    <li>position of navigation arrows</li>
                    <li>placement of pagination dots</li>
                    <li>hierarchy of text and images</li>
                    <li>applying IKEA&apos;s branding</li>
                    <li>creating interactive components</li>
                </ul>
                <p>the high fidelity prototypes gave a visual preview of how the carousel would look and feel, providing a foundational plan before coding.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-content-container">
                <h3>Iteration of the Design</h3>
                <p>The project progressed through two main iterations: a beta version that implemented four core triggers, and a final version that expanded the design into a complete, complex microinteraction with all five triggers.</p>
